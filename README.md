# Forensic-Investigations-Using-EnCase
## Project Objectives

- Apply basic digital forensic investigation skills and knowledge to analyze a hard drive using EnCase.
- Reinforce theoretical knowledge about evidence files, hashing, EnCase configuration, data searching, etc.
- Develop crucial skills during the forensic investigation process, including:
	- Using techniques (hashing) to ensure the integrity of digital evidence.
	- Collecting and preserving digital evidence.
	- Analyzing hard drive data.
	- Searching for and recovering deleted data.
	- Identifying evidence related to the case.
	- Writing analysis reports.
	- Increasing awareness of the importance of digital forensic investigation in practice.

## Project scenario

A manager ('Mr. Informant') at the tech company OOO is suspected of leaking sensitive data to a rival company through 'Spy Conspirator'. 'Mr. Informant' concealed his plan by communicating via email and sharing sample information through his personal cloud storage. When he attempted to take storage devices out of the company, he was caught at the security checkpoint. His devices (USB and CD) showed no evidence of leakage during the initial check and were sent to the forensic lab for further analysis. The task is to use Encase Forensic to find evidence of data leakage and any data that might have been generated from the suspect's electronic devices.

## Deployment

VMware Workstation Pro

## Prepare the system

| NAME  |
| ------------ |
| Encase Forensic  |
| F-RAT 1.0  |
| SQLiteStudio  |
| Kernel OST Viewer   |
| Thumbcache Viewer |
| FTK Imager |
| WinHex |

## Attention

Because this project uses Encase Forensic version 4.2.0, there are still many shortcomings, so we have to use other tools for additional support such as F-RAT 1.0, SQLiteStudio, Kernel OST Viewer, Thumbcache Viewer, FTK Imager, WinHex. If using the latest version of Encase, we do not need support from these tools.
